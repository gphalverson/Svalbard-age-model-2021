# Svalbard-age-model-2021
The code and associated files from Halverson et al. (Frontiers in Earth Sciences)

The R code for this model has been provided as a Markdown notebook. The accompanying .html file is also included, along with the required .cvs files to run the code. 

All files should be placed into a single folder prior to initiating the code.

The code requires the packages ‘rethinking’ and ‘dplyr’ to be installed, along with any dependencies. 

The notebook includes the code both for the model and for plotting and formatting a series of relevant graphs, most of which are included in the main manuscript. 

Otherwise, the code is explained in the notebook and should be relatively straightforward to run.
